So this is not a complete non informative priors. We can think to an even leff informative prior:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textrm{Beta}(1/2,1/2)$ so the the effective sample size is 1 or even go to a effective sample size close to 0 with a  prior distribution like $\\textrm{Beta}(0.001,0.001)$ . In this case all will be driven by the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The limit case would be $\\textrm{Beta}(0.,0.) \\Rightarrow f(\\theta) \\propto \\theta^{-1} (1-\\theta)^{-1}$\n",
    "The last one is not a proper density, the ingral does not give 1 : this is called as $\\textbf{improper prior}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However we can use it and we would obtain $f(y \\mid \\theta) \\propto \\theta^{y-1} (1- \\theta)^{n-y-1} \\sim \\textrm{Beta}(y,n-y)$. The posterior mean is $y/n$ that we recognize as $\\hat{\\theta}$ the maximum likelihood for the binomial. \n",
    "\n",
    "So that by using an improper prior we got a posterior which gives us a point estimates equals to the frequentist approach which by constrution depend completely from the data. But now, with respect to the frequentist approach, we can go further and build a posterior and a 95$\\%$ confidence interval that our $\\theta$ will fall there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example of improper priors: let's take the normal distribution with known $\\sigma$ and unknown $\\mu$. $Y_i \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$ and an improper normal distribution can be something like $N(0,100000^2)$ a distribution with spread variance, in the limit $\\sigma$ which tends to $\\infty$, $f(\\mu) \\sim 1$. In this case \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\mu \\mid y) = f(y \\mid \\mu) f(\\mu)= exp \\left[-\\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^2} \\sum (y_i-\\mu)^2 \\right] (1) \\propto  exp \\left[-\\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^2 /n}  (\\mu - \\bar{y})^2 \\right] \\propto N(\\bar{y}, \\sigma^2/n)   $$\n",
    "which can be recognized as the likellihood of the normal distribution. Again, even if in this case with improper prior we ended up with the result of the frequentistic approach, the advantage here is that we can build a posterior and a confidence interval for the parameters.\n",

    "\n",

For example a uniform prior for the $\\sigma$ of the normal distribution, can be $f(\\sigma^2)=1/\\sigma^2$ or $f(\\sigma^2)=1$ both are uniform in certain scale and using certain parametrization. Using different uniform prior we will get different posteriors.\n",

    "The key concept is that uniform priors are not invariant with respect to trasformation. A way to overpass this limitation is by using the $\\textbf{Jeffreys Priors}$ which use $f(\\theta) \\propto \\sqrt{I(\\theta)}$ where $I(\\theta)$ is the Fisher distribution.\n",
